# Lost in Translation: Low-resource NMT Model Performance

The goal of this project was to test different types of Neural Machine Translation models to find the best-suited one for the transaltion of low-resource datasets. This was inspired by the gap in quality of translation for underrepresented languages in many NMT models.

## OpenNMT and Hugging Face Hub

Models from HuggingFace were used along with many installed programs from the open source repo, OpenNMT.
